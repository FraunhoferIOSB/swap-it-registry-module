As stated before, the registry module provides three main functionalities. Registering swap assets to make assets available for process executions,
unregistering assets that have been registered before to make the assets unavailable and lastly, Filter Agents to return a set of available assets to a requesting client. The Filter approach is based on resource capabilities.
In the following, Tutorials for each of these approaches are provided. In addition, the code for all Tutorials is available in `Tutorials <https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/swap-it-registry-module/tree/main/tutorials>`_.
